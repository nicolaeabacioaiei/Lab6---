# Lab6---
Compulsory
The app starts from the code posted on https://profs.info.uaic.ro/~acf/java/labs/slides/lab_06.pdf
It has an error with the polygons,
despite that, I solved de compulsory task for the sixth laboratory : 
- a frame is created
- it has 3 different pannels for settings, drawing and controls(Load, save, reset and exit )
- on the canvas circles (and polygons) are drawn, in different colors and sizes
